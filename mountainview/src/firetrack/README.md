### How to compile and run the demo on a Unix system

**Prequisite:**

First, you need to have Qt4 or Qt5 development environment installed.
See: http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/gettingstarted.html

**Run from a console:**
```bash
> cd src
> qmake
> make
> cd ..
> ./demo1.sh
```

This will download some test data (if needed) and show it.

You can also run "./demo2.sh" which will run the second demo.

The first demo is displaying raw data.

The second demo is displaying >300 detected neuron profiles.
