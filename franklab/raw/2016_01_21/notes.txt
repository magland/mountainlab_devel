Notes on the reclustering:



Noise clusters:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 16, 20, 21, 22, 23, 27, 28, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 53, 59, 61, 63, 64, 66, 71, 72, 73, 74 75, 76, 77, 81, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 92,

 

Good Clusters:
 

136 – Channel 16 highest energy (1080 events, low contamination)

-       Clusters 134 and 137 (combined 333 spikes) have some spikes corresponding to 136, issue here is with spikedetekt aligning the spike

-       PC space in klustakwik inappropriately smears (peak not at center of snippet)

141 – Highest energy 10, very little contamination

-       Some spikes found in 52, again due to spikedetekt alignment issues with

 

147 – Equally high energy on 10 and 8, low contamination

-       Some spikes in 52

 

142 – Highest energy on 8, low contamination

-       Some spikes in 96, 52?

 

145  - Highest energy on 8, different shape and amplitude than 142.

-       Some spikes in 96, maybe 60 and 139 (low amplitude MUA clusters)

-       Runs into MUA (cluster 139)

 

107  - Highest energy on 4, some spikes in 148 due to alignment issues in spikedetekt

 

148 – Highest energy on 4 some spikes in 107 due to alignment issues in spikedetekt

 

 150 – Highest energy on 3, 44 and 13 contain spikes, due to jittering of spikedetekt

 

152 – Highest energy on 3, some on 1. 44 and 13 contain spikes, due to jittering of spikedetekt

 

153 – Highest energy on 7, good isolation

 

98 – Highest energy on 9, good isolation, low contamination

-       some spikes in 97 due to jitter

 

99 – Highest energy on 9, also on 7. Good isolation, low contamination

-       some spikes in 97 due to jitter

 

24 – Highest energy on 9, no energy elsewhere. Fair isolation, possibly some lost to noise. Otherwise clean

 

154 – Highest energy on 11, good isolation, some noise due to jitter but very clean

 

19 – highest energy on 13, also on 11. Good isolation from noise, but some overlap with 100

 

100 – highest energy on 13 and 15. Good isolation from noise, but some possible overlap with 19

 

8 – Highest energy on 17, fair isolation from noise. Some probably lost to noise

 

25 – Equal energy on 17 and 15, good isolation from noise.

 

70 – Highest energy on 14, 15, 17, little on 16. Fair isolation

 

MUA/poor isolation clusters:

 

127 – Highest energy on 15, looks like the tail of both 155 and 156, running into low amplitude MUA cluster 157

 

155 – Highest energy on 15, tail runs into both cluster 156 and cluster 127

 

156 – High energy on 15 and 17, tail runs into both cluster 155 and cluster 127


133 – Channel 16 and 14 high energy, 149 events

- high levels of contamination with 134 and 137

 

138 – Channel 18 and 16 high energy, 846 events.

            - contamination, clusters 6, 43, 54, 69, 129,

 

79 – MUA cluster nearly running into noise, highest energy channel 10, probably high contamination from other MUA clusters

 

17 – MUA cluster running into the noise, highest energy channels 1, 2, 3

 

14 – MUA biggest on 3 and 5, running into noise

 

12 – Low energy MUA cluster, equal on 15 and 13. Running into noise

 

157 – low energy MUA cluster, highest on 15
